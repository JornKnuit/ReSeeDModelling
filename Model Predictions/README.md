The model predictions folder is divided into three subfolders:

The folder "Full Data" contains species richness, community-weighted mean traits, and relevant environmental variables (forest age and forest cover) at the fragment level for each of the analyses that was performed seperately (AF Birds, All Birds, Nonvolant Mammals, Volant Mammals, and the complete frugivore community).

The folder "Presence" contains the HMSC model predictions. This is presence/absence data in the form of a matrix for each of the models.

The folder "Network Model" contains a file similar to the ones in the "Full Data" folder. However, instead of species richness and traits this dataset contains the network metrics that were calculated for the fragment-level plant-frugivore networks.
