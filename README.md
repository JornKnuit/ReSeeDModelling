This page provides the main datasets that were used for the project "The Effects of Reforestation and Fragmentation on Plant-Frugivore Networks in São Paulo, Brazil - A Modelling Approach". For this project, frugivore communities were predicted for 102 forest fragments across the state of São Paulo, Brazil. This was done using the Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) framework. This repository contains the input data used for all seperate taxon-specific models, as well as model predictions (presence/absence, species richness, community-weighted mean traits) and network metrics that were calculated for generated plant-frugivore networks.
